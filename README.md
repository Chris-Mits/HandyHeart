Hello Everyone!

My name is Chris Mits (Χρήστος Μητσιάρης) and i created this website for an assignement in my university.
We were tasked in creating a Charity website. This project is currently uploaded in Netlify and is being evaluated for grade by my teacher until the end of month June.
Also, this project is public because the code will also be evaluated by my teacher.
All i ask is please please please DO NOT make any changes to the original repo because those changes will be reflected instantly in the hosted website at Netlify.
That being said, you are free to fork and make any other changes but please do not contribute to the original repository using pull requests.

Thank you!!
